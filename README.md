# Truck Route Planner
Optimization of Truck Logistics for the Disposal of Voluminous Waste: A Multicriteria Approach

The objective of this project is the development of software to optimize the management of the
collection of voluminous waste, specifically addressing the challenges associated with
**Traveling Salesman Problem** (TSP) and the **Vehicle Routing Problem** (VRP). 

These problems, being NP-complete, present a series of complexities that require intelligent and efficient solutions to ensure optimal route management.
The development of efficient software for bulky waste management must address these
mathematical challenges and advanced algorithms, providing approximate solutions that can
approach the optimal solution in reasonable computational times. The successful implementation of these
strategies will ensure efficient and sustainable route management.

The project delves into the specific location of Gran Canaria in Canary Islands, but can be replicated towards other cases.

Features presented:

- Distance by road and estimated time calculated with **GraphHopper Routing API**
- Real map generated with **Folium**
- **Multicriteria with multi-variable restrictions** model engine personalized for pickup of voluminous objects
- **Hungarian algorithm** robust method for m√≠nimum search
- Most **optimal route search** optimization amongst numerous combinations
